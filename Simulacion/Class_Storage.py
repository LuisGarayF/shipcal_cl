class Storage_Tank:
    '''
    One-dimensional model for a vertical, cylindrical, stratified tank for thermal energy storage.
    This model divides the tank into nodes which are vertically arranged. Within each node, the temperature is assumed to be uniform.
    The model assumes that the fluid stored has properties (density, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity) which are undependent from its temperature.
    The model allows two inlet-outlet pairs. The flow leaving the tank through an outlet is automatically equal to the flow entering the tank through its associated inlet, so that the mass and volume in the tank are maintained.
    
    Initialization parameters:
        - Volume: Total volume of the tank (m^3).
        - AR: Aspect ratio ( i.e. height/diameter ) (no units)
        - top_loss_coeff: thermal loss coefficient in the top surface of the tank ( kJ / ( hr * m^2 *K ) ).
        - edge_loss_coeff: thermal loss coefficient in the lateral surface of the tank ( kJ / ( hr * m^2 *K ) ).
        - bottom_loss_coeff: thermal loss coefficient in the bottom surface of the tank ( kJ / ( hr * m^2 *K ) ).
        - N_nodes: number of nodes into which the tank is divided (no units).
        - inlet_1_node: node where the first inlet to the tank is located (no units).
        - outlet_1_node: node where the first outlet to the tank (associated to inlet 1) is located (no units).
        - inlet_2_node: node where the second inlet to the tank is located (no units).
        - outlet_2_node: node where the second outlet to the tank (associated to inlet 2) is located (no units).
        - fluid_props: object of the class "Properties_water" to define the properties of the fluid.
        - initial_temperatures: dictionary with the initial temperatures of each node. It has the format: {1: T1, 2: T2, 3: T3, ..... , N: TN } where N is the number of nodes (node 1 is the top node) and T1, T2, etc are the temperatures of the nodes in °C.
        - tolerance: maximum discrepancy between successive iterations of the tank which is allowed to yield the tank outputs (no units).
        - max_iterations: maximum number of iterations permitted until the outputs of the tank are yielded despite no convergence has been reached (no units).
        
    Attributes (See Initialization parameters for the ones that have no description):
        - self.cross_Area: cross-sectional area of the tank
        - self.N_nodes
        - self.node_temperatures: dictionary contanining the current temperatures. It is initialized as "initial_temperatures" (See Initialization parameters)
        - self.top_loss_coeff
        - self.edge_loss_coeff
        - self.bottom_loss_coeff
        - self.node_height: height of each node
        - self.nodal_edge_area: lateral area of each node
        - self.node_volume: volume of each node
        - self.inlets_and_outlets: dictionary to store the nodes where the inlets and outlets are located. It has the format: {'inlet_1': inlet_1_node, 'outlet_1': outlet_1_node, 'inlet_2': inlet_2_node, 'outlet_2': outlet_2_node} (See initialization parameters)
        - self.max_iterations
        - self.fluid_props
        - self.tolerance
        - self.new_temperatures: dictionary used to store the last computed outputs, in order to update the temperatures of the tank once convergence is achieved in the rest of the system. This attribute is not defined until the self.compute_outputs method is used for the first time (See that method for more detail)
    
    Methods:
        - self.convergence: evaluates whether convergence has been achieved in order to yield the solutions.
        - self.mix_nodes: mixes unstable nodes at the end of the time step
        - self.iteration: executes an iteration to find the solution of the current time step
        - self.compute_outputs: executes several iterations until convergence is achieved. Then it returns the resulting specific enthalpies at the outlets.
        - self.update_temperature: updates the temperatures of the tank to the ones determined in the last output-computation
